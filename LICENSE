  The future of this license

    It might well happen that this program will be distributed under
    the GPL or the Perl Artistic License in a future version. Even
    (Even? No, cut that word. :-) as professional software
    developers we are using and recommending a lot of free software,
    including sendmail, Perl or the MIME::Entity modules which are
    the base of this product. We beg to understand, that we first
    would like to be payed for the time we have put into
    IspMailGate. We'll see what happens.
