NAME
    ispMailGate - a general purpose filtering MDA for sendmail

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
    This is an alpha release! What you are using now is tested by
    using a comparatively small test suite in our local environment.
    You are perhaps planning to include this software in a
    production environment. We don't discourage to do so, but we
    strongly advise you to be extremely careful. In particular,
    start by filtering only mails for a very small number of email
    adresses, perhaps your own and something similar. That is, be
    extremely cautios when modifying your sendmail configuration.

    See INSTALLATION and SENDMAIL CONFIGURATION below for a detailed
    description of your sendmail setup.

SYNOPSIS
    For running standalone:

        ispMailGateD -f <sender> <recipient1> [... <recipientN>]

    For running as a daemon:

        ispMailGateD -s [-d] [-t <tmpdir>] [-a <facility>] [-p <pidfile>]
            [-u <unixsock>]

DESCRIPTION
    IspMailGate is a general purpose email filtering system. The
    program gets included into a sendmail configuration as a
    delivery agent (MDA) and the usual sendmail rules can be applied
    for deciding which emails to feed into ispMailGate. The true
    filters are implemented as modules, so its easy to extend the
    possibilities of ispMailGate. Current modules offer automatic
    compression and decompression, encryption, decryption and
    certification with PGP or virus scanning.

    The program can run in a usual standalone mode, but that's not
    recommended, except for debugging and similar tasks. The
    recommended mode will be running the program as a server,
    completely independent from sendmail. A small C program (called
    a wrapper) will instead be configured as sendmails MDA. This
    wrapper connects to the server via a well known Unix socket (by
    default /var/run/ispmailgate.sock), passes its command line
    arguments and standard input to the server and disconnects.
    Obviously this second solution has much better performance as
    you load the Perl interpreter only once.

  Command Line Interface

    The following options affect ispMailGate's behaviour:

    --facility=<fac>
        Advices the ispMailGate to use syslog facility <fac>. By
        default syslog entries are written as facility mail.

    --debug
        The program runs in debugging mode, logging information into
        the syslog. Perhaps more information than you like ... :-)

    --from=<sender>
        Sets a mails sender.

    --server
        Tells the program not to run in standalone mode and instead
        detach from the shell to enter server mode. This mode is
        currently not usable, as the wrapper is not yet available.

    --tmp-dir=<dir>
        Sets the programs directory for temporary files to <dir>.
        When unpacking a complex and big multipart mail, the
        ispMailGate may need surprisingly much space. By default
        /var/spool/ispmailgate is used.

    --unix-sock=<sock>
        Tells the server to listen on file <sock> for unix socket
        connections. By default the server uses
        /var/run/ispmailgate.sock.

INSTALLATION
  Requirements

    To start with the requirements: You need

    1.) A running sendmail (recommended: 8.9.3 or later); if you
    don't have sendmail or an older version, you find the current
    release at

        ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail

    2.) A late version of Perl (5.005 or later); if you don't have
    Perl, get it from any CPAN mirror, for example

        ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/src/5.0

    3.) The MIME-tools module (version 4.116 or later), its
    prerequired modules (MailTools, MIME-Base64 and IO-Stringy) and
    the IO::Tee module (version 0.61 or later). All these modules
    are available from any CPAN mirror, for example

        ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/modules/Mail
        ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/modules/MIME
        ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/modules/IO

    Installing a Perl module is quite easy, btw. Either you use the
    automatic CPAN interface (requires an Internet connection or
    something similar) by executing

        perl -MCPAN -e shell

    or you fetch the modules with FTP, extract the tar.gz files, go
    into the distribution directory (for example MIME-tools-4.116)
    and do a

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    You'll like it! :-)

  System preparation

    Although ispMailGate is usually started as root, because certain
    initialization settings need root permissions, it must not
    continue running as root. Instead it impersonates itself to the
    same UID and GID that sendmail uses for delivering mails. In
    what follows, I assume UID *daemon* and GID <mail>, as used on a
    Red Hat Linux box.

    IspMailGate needs its own directory for creating temporary
    files. Usually this could be `/var/spool/ispmailgate' or
    something similar. Make sure that the daemon user from above,
    (but noone else) has access to this directory:

        mkdir /var/spool/ispmailgate
        chown daemon /var/spool/ispmailgate
        chgrp mail /var/spool/ispmailgate
        chmod 700 /var/spool/ispmailgate

  Program installation

    The program is installable like any other Perl module. Indeed,
    you can even use the automatic CPAN installation. If you are not
    used to CPAN installation or cannot use the CPAN shell, you need
    to perform a manual installation: First, fetch the archive from
    any CPAN mirror, for example

        ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/authors/id/JWIED

    and extract the archive with

        gzip -cd Mail-IspMailGate-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -

    After that, do a

        cd Mail-IspMailGate-<version>

    and do a

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test           # You need to be root here!
        make install        # You need to be root here!

    While running "perl Makefile.PL", you'll be prompted a lot of
    questions. In general you can answer them by simply hitting
    return, the defaults should be fine. The questions are explained
    in the section CONFIGURATION FILE below, because your answers
    are used for creating this config file. the section on
    "CONFIGURATION FILE".

    If "make test" reports any errors, let me know.

SENDMAIL CONFIGURATION
    To understand the required sendmail configuration, let's first
    take a look at the following diagram:

            +----------------+
            | Incoming       |
            | mail for       |
            | joe@ispsoft.de |
            +----------------+

                |
                | Port 25
                | (SMTP)
                |

            +----------------------+        +---------------------+
            |                      |        |                     |
            |  Sendmail, with      |        |  IspMailGate        |
            |  IspMailGate support |  ----> |  receives and       |
            |  integrated          |        |  processes the mail |
            |                      |        |                     |
            +----------------------+        +---------------------+

               V                                    |
                                                    |
            +---------------------------+           | Port 26
            | mailertable:              |           |
            | ispsoft.de => ispmailgate |           |
            +---------------------------+           |

                                          +-----------------------+
            +-------------------------+   |                       |
            | Other mailertable:      |   |  Second sendmail,     |
            | ispsoft.de => mailhost  | < |  without IspMailGate, |
            +-------------------------+   |  other mailertable    |
                                          |                       |
                                          +-----------------------+

    The idea is that we have two sendmail instances: The first one
    is accepting mails from the outside world (it could well be
    smapd or another SMTP wrapper).

    Mails accepted by the first instance will optionally be piped
    into IspMailGate, depending on your mailertable or whatever
    method you choose for selecting a delivery agent.

    As soon as IspMailGate has processed your mails, they cannot be
    delivered to the same sendmail: Sendmail would detect the same
    recipients as before, and feed the mail back into IspMailGate.
    The immediate result would be an endless loop.

    Instead we configure another instance of sendmail, running for
    example on port 26, which accepts mails by IspMailGate. This
    second sendmail will typically be protected to the outside
    world, for example by using a packet filter.

    Of course it is possible to replace the second sendmail with a
    mail server running on another machine. However, I discourage
    you to do so, because IspMailGate has no integrated spooling
    system: If the foreign host would be down, you mail would be
    lost forever! However, you can easily configure the second
    sendmail for delivery to the same host, this time using a safe
    spooling system.

  Details

    Before reading on, you should have some basic knowledge on
    sendmail configuration. In particular you should be used to work
    with

    sendmail.mc
        the m4 macro file that is used to create sendmail.cf (If you
        had the impression that hacking sendmail.cf is the method of
        choice for configuring sendmail, your knowledge of sendmail
        is a little bit too basic :-)

    mailertable
        the file that is used for selecting delivery agents, based
        on a domain name

    sendmail.cw
        the file that is used for selecting "local" domains.

    All these files are described in the file cf/README from the
    sendmail distribution. The same file is available online as
    sendmail documentation on http://www.sendmail.org. I strongly
    encourage you to read about it.

    In what follows I assume that we have two hosts:
    *gate.ispsoft.de* is a firewall running IspMailGate and two
    instances of sendmail. *mail.ispsoft.de* is the real mail
    server. Mail for the domain *ispsoft.de* shall be checked by
    IspMailGate, passed to the second instance of sendmail and
    finally delivered to the real mail server.

    Furthermore I assume that the cf files from the sendmail
    distribution are in /usr/lib/sendmail-cf. This is the case on a
    Red Hat Linux box, if you have installed the RPM package
    *sendmail-cf*. It may be /usr/share/sendmail with SuSE Linux or
    anything else on another system.

    First of all we copy the file examples/ispmailgate.m4 from the
    IspMailGate distribution to /usr/lib/sendmail-cf/mailer. Then we
    create the following files:

    /etc/mail/sendmail.mc
          divert(-1)
          include(`/usr/lib/sendmail-cf/m4/cf.m4')
          define(`confCW_FILE', `/etc/mail/sendmail.cw')
          define(`ALIAS_FILE', `/etc/mail/aliases')
          define(`QUEUE_DIR', `/var/spool/mqueue')
          OSTYPE(`linux')
          FEATURE(use_cw_file)
          FEATURE(mailertable, `hash -o /etc/mail/mailertable')
          FEATURE(virtusertable, `hash -o /etc/mail/virtusertable')
          FEATURE(access_db)
          MAILER(local)
          MAILER(smtp)
          MAILER(ispmailgate)

    /etc/mail2/sendmail.mc
          divert(-1)
          include(`/usr/lib/sendmail-cf/m4/cf.m4')
          define(`confCW_FILE', `/etc/mail/sendmail.cw')
          define(`ALIAS_FILE', `/etc/mail/aliases')
          define(`QUEUE_DIR', `/var/spool/mqueue2')
          define(`confDAEMON_OPTIONS', `port=26')
          OSTYPE(`linux')
          FEATURE(use_cw_file)
          FEATURE(mailertable, `hash -o /etc/mail2/mailertable')
          FEATURE(virtusertable, `hash -o /etc/mail/virtusertable')
          FEATURE(access_db)
          MAILER(local)
          MAILER(smtp)

        You see, this is almost the same file, with three
        exceptions:

    1.)     The first sendmail is running on the default port 25,
            because it has no special port settings. The second
            sendmail is running on port 26.

    2.)     The first sendmail is using /etc/mail/mailertable, the
            second has /etc/mail2/mailertable.

    3.)     The second sendmail doesn't have a mailer ispmailgate.

    4.)     The first sendmail is using another spool directory,
            /var/spool/mqueue2. (I am not sure, whether this is
            required, however it doesn't harm, so let's be on the
            safe side.)

    /etc/mail/mailertable
          ispsoft.de    ispmailgate:ispsoft.de

    /etc/mail2/mailertable
          ispsoft.de    ispmailgate:mail.ispsoft.de

        You see, the only difference between these two instances of
        mailertable is that the domain *ispsoft.de* is treated
        different.

    Finally we have to execute some commands to get this
    configuration running:

            mkdir /var/spool/mqueue2
            # The following should match the settings of
            # /var/spool/mqueue exactly.
            chown root /var/spool/mqueue2
            chgrp root /var/spool/mqueue2
            chmod 755 /var/spool/mqueue

            cd /etc/mail
            m4 sendmail.mc >sendmail.cf
            makemap hash mailertable <mailertable
            cd /etc/mail2
            m4 sendmail.mc >sendmail.cf
            makemap hash mailertable <mailertable

    The above is fine for Linux. On other operating systems you
    might need to use GNU m4 rather than the builtin m4 and replace
    the map type *hash* with *dbm*. In particular this applies to
    Solaris.

    Finally, kill any running sendmail and start the new versions
    with

            chmod 755 /etc/mail /etc/mail2
            chmod 644 /etc/mail/sendmail.cf /etc/mail2/sendmail.cf
            /usr/sbin/sendmail -C /etc/mail/sendmail.cf -bd -q1h
            /usr/sbin/sendmail -C /etc/mail2/sendmail.cf -bd -q1h

    (The chmod commands because sendmail is *really* picky about
    group writable files and directories.)

CONFIGURATION FILE
    The program depends on a local configuration file, read as the
    Mail::IspMailGate::Config module. In other words, this
    configuration file is pure Perl code defining certain variables
    under the name space Mail::IspMailGate::Config. The module is
    read from the file
    /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/Mail/IspMailGate/Config.pm.

    The following variables are meaningful to the program:

    VERSION
        The programs version; do not modify without a good reason.

    tmp_dir
        Set's the default directory for creating temporary files,
        currently /var/spool/ispmailgate. You can modify this with
        the `--tmpdir' directive, see above.

    unix_sock
        The unix socket that the client connects to, currently
        /var/run/ispmailgate.sock. You can use the `--unixsock'
        argument for overwriting the default.

    pid_file
        The PID file where a running server stores its PID,
        currently /var/run/ispmailgate.pid. You can use the `--
        pidfile' argument for overwriting the default.

    mail_user
    mail_group
        IspMailGate is running as this user and group, by default
        daemon and mail.

    mail_host
        The host to use for passing mails after processing them by
        the mail filter. By default 'localhost' is used, in other
        words, the mails are immediately passed back to sendmail.

        To omit a possible loop problem, sendmail must be ready for
        handling email addresses like user@domain.ispmailgate. For
        such addresses it must rip off the .ispmailgate and
        guarantee not to feed the mails back into ispMailGate. See
        the section on "SENDMAIL CONFIGURATION" below.

    recipients
        An array ref with list of possible recipients/senders and
        filter lists that describe how to handle mails being sent
        from the senders to the recipients.

        Each element of the list is a hash ref with the following
        elements:

    recipient
            A regular expression (Perl regular expression, that is)
            for matching the recipient address. An empty string
            matches any recipient.

    sender  A regular expression (Perl regular expression, again) for
            matching the sender address. An empty string matches any
            sender.

    filters An array ref to a list of filters. A mail will be fed into
            that list (from the left to the right) and the final
            result will be returned to sendmail. See the
            Mail::IspMailGate::Filter(3) manpage for a description
            of creating filters.

        The recipient list will be read top to bottom, the first
        match decides which rule to choose. See the example
        configuration below for some example rules.

    default_filter
        If no element of the recipients list matches an emails
        senders and recipients, the filters from this variable will
        be choosen. By default it contains a dummy filter:

          $cfg->{'default_filter'} = ['Mail::IspMailGate::Filter::Dummy'];

    packer
        This variable belongs to the Packer module. See the
        Mail::IspMailGate::Packer(3) manpage for details.

    virscan
        These belong to the VirScan module. See the
        Mail::IspMailGate::VirScan(3) manpage for details.

    pgp This variable belong to the PGP module. See the
        Mail::IspMailGate::PGP(3) manpage for details.

  Example Configuration

    It might help to look at a commented example of the
    configuration file:

        package Mail::IspMailGate::Config;
